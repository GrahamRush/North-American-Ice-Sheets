# North-American-Ice-Sheets
History of ice sheets and ice caps from the Last Glacial Maximum to present in North America, as produced by Dyke et al. (2003)

### Ice sheet GIS Files

The folder "ProjectedOriginal" contains the original GIS shapefiles published by Dyke et al. (2003). These have been renamed by A. Wickert to a standard format that is:

```
iceXXXXXX.*
```

where "XXXXXX" corresponds to an age in RADIOCARBON years BP that is zero-padded for easier machine reading and sorting. Because these ages are in radiocarbon years, one must use a converter (such as [http://calib.qub.ac.uk/calib/calib.html][IntCal13]) to obtain the proper calendar ages.

*I have plans to soon add a version of these files that has been reprojected into a geographic coordiante system (WGS84). this is currently a placeholder for that.*

### Purpose

This Geological Survey of Canada Open File Report was previsouly available online, but as it does not seem to be any longer, I am copying the core GIS files and description here, and plan to include a version that is projected to WGS84 and includes only ice and proglacial lakes (as land and ocean will change via sea level change and glacial isostatic adjustment, which is not represented here).

I am currently not including the paleogeographic map images that were part of the original open-file report, as the purpose of this repository is to share the data rather than to reproduce the publication.

### Citation

Users of this data set should reference:

* Dyke, A. S., A. Moore, and L. Robertson (2003), *Deglaciation of North America*, Open File 1574, Natural Resources Canada, Ottawa.

An additional paper that could be useful to read and reference is:

* Dyke, A. (2004), An outline of North American deglaciation with emphasis on central and northern Canada, in *Quaternary Glaciations--Extent and Chronology --- Part II: North America*, vol. 2, edited by J. Ehlers and P. L. Gibbard, pp. 373â€“424.

It is available from [http://academic.macewan.ca/furzem/files/2011/10/Dyke-2004.pdf]. These paleogeographic maps and the base data were also published in a CD companion to this volume.
